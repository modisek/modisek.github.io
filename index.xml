Automation is all the rage nowadays with concepts like infrastructure as code being very popular in all parts of computing, and since my setup hasnt changed much in years i decided it would benefit me to automate it so that the next time i need to reinstall i would not have to install and set up everything by hand.I had already hosted my dotfiles on git and used those in my previous installs, but this time i wanted to automate the installation of the applications as well not just their settings.</description></item><item><title>My Linux Dev Setup</title><link>https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-linux-dev-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:57:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-linux-dev-setup/</guid><description>

Why linux I have been using linux for a few years now and i dont see myself going back to windows machine anytime soon,as a developer linux offers me powerful tools that help me be productive.The commandline is way more efficient and allows me to automate with ease some of my most common tasks.
I prefer linux distributions that allow me to build my setup from scratch, they just provide the base system and i can choose what software to install, this reduces bloat, allows me to chose sooftware that is lightweight, this is importatnt because i have luckluster hardware, i use an old lenovo laptop with low Ram, and to add salt to injury the Ram is soldered into the motherboard meaning that it cant be upgraded.</description></item><item><title>My blog setup with hugo and github pages</title><link>https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-blog-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 01:19:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-blog-setup/</guid><description>
