Learning Golang or the Go language has been on my todo list for a while now and i have decided to finally learn it this year, it seems to be interesting will see how it goes and will update on how its going on this blog,

coming from other languages such as java which is verbose and contains a lot of boilerplate , Golang seems like a breath of fresh air, hearded it is easier to learn as well, so its will be an understatement to say am very excited to start Learning
