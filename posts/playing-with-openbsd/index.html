changed to cwm window manager since am already familiar with it, its the one am currently using on my void linux install.</p><p>i have always liked bsd projects and have used ports of them on linux for example i use cwm which is now the default wm on openbsd, i have used doas to replace sudo, and i used ksh which is the default shell on bsd,so most of those where not new to me, but that is not to say i ddnt enccouter some differences to linux, for example some commands are different like to view storahge devices and so on</p><p>used syspatch to keep it upto date</p><pre><code>syspatch 

</code></pre><p>learnt how to use the package manager, installed essential software like git vim etc</p><pre><code>doas pkg_add git

</code></pre><p>learn how to manage services using rcctl</p><pre><code>doas rcctl start sshd

</code></pre><p>I also found out that openbsd ships with a webserver httpd and a loadbalancer relayd and will play with those services to host a website.</p><h4 id=summary>Summary</h4><p>I like it a lot so far, it is both lightweight and performant.Its missing some software from linux from the ports, but i can build most of what i need from source if its compatible with openbsd, and will encourage other people to try it.</p><p>To be able to be replace my void install it would have to be able to do hardware accelleration(va-api) so am able to consume video content without the cpu going haywire, wayland support as well woul be appreciated</p><p><a href=https://www.openbsd.org/>openbsd</a></p></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><p>Copyright © 2021 Kgosietsile Modise</p></div></div></footer><script src=https://modisek.github.io/assets/main.js></script><script src=https://modisek.github.io/assets/prism.js></script></div></body></html>
