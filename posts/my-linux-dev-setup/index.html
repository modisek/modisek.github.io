This is part of a series i am doing on my linux setup</p><ol><li><blockquote><p><a href=#>my linux setup(overview)</a></p></blockquote></li><li><a href=https://modisek.github.io/posts/ansible-dev-laptop/>setting up linux using ansible</a></li></ol><h3 id=details-of-my-setup>Details of my Setup</h3><table><thead><tr><th>item</th><th>details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>os</td><td>void linux(musl)</td></tr><tr><td>wm</td><td>cwm</td></tr><tr><td>term</td><td>uxterm</td></tr><tr><td>Ide</td><td>nvim + tmux</td></tr><tr><td>font</td><td>terminus</td></tr><tr><td>bar</td><td>dzen2</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=cwm-window-manager>Cwm window manager</h3><p>Due to the low memory i chose not to use a desktop environment but rather a <strong>window manager</strong>, the latter being lightweigt and also has cool features such as tilling and better use of screen real estate in my opinion since there are no window decorations and other useless fluff.The wm i chose is called cwm an Xorg window manager, its floating by default but can also tile at the press of a button, it gets out of my way and provides searching for windows if you opened too many windows and struggling to find your way to the app you need.</p><p>I have been thinking of moving away from Xorg to wayland, but i have struggled to get the same experience in wayland as i do in x11, wayland and wayland compositors are still a work in progress and i havent had time to look at how to configure a wayland compositor to get the same setup am used to, but if i do move away from x11 i will try hikari since it is the spiritual successor to cwm, i have taken a look at it, the documentation on it is rather lacking.</p><p>My editor of choice is neovim since it doesnt use a lot of ram and starts up quickly, with their 0.5 release neovim became even more powerful with the addition of a native lsp and tressiter for syntax highliting, also its modal style of editing is both unique an impressive , i use a colourscheme i created myself, wanted calming colours that are easy to look at for extended periods of time,the plugins that i use most is telescope, a fuzzy finder that allows me to open files very quickly</p><h3 id=tmux-to-create-an-ide-like-setup>Tmux to create an ide like setup</h3><p>Tmux is used to multiplex my terminal so i have multiple panes on one terminal,this allows me to have an editor in one pane and also have a terminal in which i can run commands such as launching a server, testing etc</p><h3 id=misc>Misc</h3><p>The bar at the top is basically a bash script i wrote that is piped into a program knowns as dzen
i prefer terminal applications to gui since they have less memory requirement</p><p>The tuis and lightweight apps that i use are:</p><ul><li>mpd & ncmpcpp to play music</li><li>zathura for viewing pdf</li><li>pcmanfm for viewing files</li><li>imv/feh for viewng images</li><li>mpv for playing videos</li><li>autojump to quickly go to directories</li><li>fzf to find files</li></ul><blockquote><p>definition of some terms
<strong>zram</strong> compresses stuff before its put on ram so you can fit more things in ram,makes it seem like the computer has more ram, this comes at the expense of some performance hit due to compression and decompression
<strong>window manager</strong> is a lightweigt alternative to heavy desktop enviroments like gnome for example</p></blockquote><p>link to my dotfiles: <a href=https://github.com/modisek/dotfiles>dots</a></p></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><p>Copyright © 2021 Kgosietsile Modise</p></div></div></footer><script src=https://modisek.github.io/assets/main.js></script><script src=https://modisek.github.io/assets/prism.js></script></div></body></html>
