plan 9 is a research operating system from bell labs that was supposedly the successor to unix,it had different ideas of how an operating system should function, this is clearly shown by its components, from the window manager rio, a minimalist window manager that only gave the user the minimun needed to use the damn thing, with its color scheme, a stark white and teal combination of color and its editor acme that can also be used as a file manager</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/plan9/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://modisek.github.io/posts/workflow/>My workflow</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2022-01-02</span></div><div class=post-content>How to move fast in bash 1.

Automation is all the rage nowadays with concepts like infrastructure as code being very popular in all parts of computing, and since my setup hasnt changed much in years i decided it would benefit me to automate it so that the next time i need to reinstall i would not have to install and set up everything by hand.I had already hosted my dotfiles on git and used those in my previous installs, but this time i wanted to automate the installation of the applications as well not just their settings.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/ansible-dev-laptop/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-linux-dev-setup/>My Linux Dev Setup</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2021-11-19</span></div><figure class=post-cover><img src=https://modisek.github.io/imgs/preview.png alt="My Linux Dev Setup"></figure><div class=post-content>Why linux I have been using linux for a few years now and honestly i dont see myself going back to a non unix like operating system anytime soon,as a developer linux offers me powerful tools that help me be productive.The commandline is way more efficient and allows me to automate with ease some of my most common tasks.I have written a few bash scripts that help me with a few common daily things i do like watching youtube videos through mpv media player, a script to automate tmux so i can start working on a project faster.</div><div><a class="read-more button" href=/posts/my-linux-dev-setup/>Read more →</a></div></div><div class="post on-list"><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-blog-setup/>My blog setup with hugo and github pages</a></h1><div class=post-meta><span class=post-date>2021-11-14</span></div><div class=post-content>I wanted an easy and cheap way to create and host my blog site and hugo came out on top for its ease of setup, and i decided to host it on github pages since it was free.You can find out more about github pages and hugo ,hugo is a static site generator written in GO.
