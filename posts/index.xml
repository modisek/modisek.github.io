Automation is all the rage nowadays with concepts like infrastructure as code being very popular in all parts of computing, and since my setup hasnt changed much in years i decided it would benefit me to automate it so that the next time i need to reinstall i would not have to install and set up everything by hand.I had already hosted my dotfiles on git and used those in my previous installs, but this time i wanted to automate the installation of the applications as well not just their settings.</description></item><item><title>My Linux Dev Setup</title><link>https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-linux-dev-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:57:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-linux-dev-setup/</guid><description>

Why linux I have been using linux for a few years now and honestly i dont see myself going back to a non unix like operating system anytime soon,as a developer linux offers me powerful tools that help me be productive.The commandline is way more efficient and allows me to automate with ease some of my most common tasks.I have written a few bash scripts that help me with a few common daily things i do like watching youtube videos through mpv media player, a script to automate tmux so i can start working on a project faster.</description></item><item><title>My blog setup with hugo and github pages</title><link>https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-blog-setup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 01:19:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://modisek.github.io/posts/my-blog-setup/</guid><description>
